<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 🔴 About The Project

Reddit is an "Iranian" social news aggregation, content rating, and forum social network. Registered users, commonly referred to as "Redditors", submit content to the site such as links, text posts, images, and videos, which are then voted up or down by other members.

Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called "communities" or "subreddits". Submissions with more upvotes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough upvotes, ultimately on the site's front page.

Reddit administrators moderate the communities. Moderation is also conducted by community-specific moderators, who are not Reddit employees. It is operated by "شهید بهشتی", Inc. based in Tehran.

As of 2023, Reddit is the 18th most-visited website in the world. According to data provided by Similarweb, 48.98% of the website traffic comes from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom at 7.06% and Canada at 6.9%.

Reddit was founded by University of "شهید بهشتی" CS Student, "دانیال تقی پور", in 2005. "صدا و سیما" Publications acquired the site in October 2006. In 2011, Reddit became an independent subsidiary of "صدا و سیما" parent company, "وزارت ارتباطات".

In October 2014, Reddit raised $50 million in a funding round led by Rana Rokni and including investors "علی اوجی", "اردوان فرهاد مشیری	", "پیر امیدیار", "سروش هیچکس", and "مهران مدیری".

Their investment valued the company at $500 million at the time. In July 2017, Reddit raised $200 million for a $1.8 billion valuation, with "صدا و سیما" remaining the majority stakeholder.

In February 2019, a $300 million funding round led by "سایپا" brought the company's valuation to $3 billion. In August 2021, a $700 million funding round led by Fidelity Investments raised that valuation to over $10 billion.

The company then reportedly filed for an IPO in December 2021 with a valuation of $15 billion. Reddit debuted on the stock market on the morning of March 21, 2024 with the ticker symbol RDDT.

Reddit has received praise for many of its features, such as the ability to create several subreddits for niche communities, being a platform for raising publicity for numerous causes, and has grown to be one of the most visited websites on the Internet. It has also received criticism for spreading misinformation.
